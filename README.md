# Final project for the course "Simulation"

The goal of the project was to develop a simulation in AnyLogic using a combination of Discrete Event Simulation (DES) and Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) to represent the real system of the emergency department at CEMIC Hospital. Based on historical data analysis, we simulated patient flow and evaluated different strategies to reduce waiting times, minimize patient dropouts, and optimize the use of medical resources according to demand across different time periods.
